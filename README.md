# Structured Lightweight Authoring Protocol (SLAP)

**Version:** 1.2  
**Date:** 2025-04-10  
**Tagline:** SLAP: Finally, a spec that wonâ€™t make your parser cry.

## Overview

SLAP is a minimalistic markup language designed for clear, structured documentation. It is optimized for human readability and efficient processing by AI agentsâ€”delivering low token overhead without sacrificing essential structure. SLAP is our evolution of Compact Structured Markup (CSM) with enhanced inline annotation rules, improved error recovery, and support for multi-line text blocks.

## Key Features

- **Minimal Syntax & Clear Structure:**  
  Uses only essential reserved tokens and consistent indentation to define document structure in a line-oriented manner.

- **Optimized for Token Efficiency:**  
  Designed to reduce unnecessary tokens, making it ideal for integration with AI agents and large-scale documentation.

- **Enhanced Inline Annotations:**  
  Supports in-line notes using both parentheses and bracketsâ€”with brackets recommended to avoid ambiguity in AI processing.
  - *Example:*  
    ```
    text: This is a sentence [note: do not delete the database again].
    ```

- **Multi-Line Text Blocks:**  
  Support for open/close delimiters (e.g., `>>>` and `<<<`) allows long-form paragraphs to be written naturally without forced line breaks.
  - *Example:*
    ```
    text:
      >>>
      This is a long paragraph spanning multiple lines.
      It allows for more natural narrative flow.
      <<<
    ```

- **Robust Error Handling & Recovery:**  
  Guidelines ensure that parsing errors are logged with context and processing continues with the next logical block, improving resilience for complex documents.

- **Extensible & Customizable:**  
  Built-in support for custom directives (using the `x-` prefix) and extended block types ensures that SLAP can evolve to meet future needs while preserving backward compatibility.

## Specification

The full SLAP specification is detailed in [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md). It covers:

- Design goals and general syntax guidelines.
- Reserved tokens for core document structure (meta, header, text, list, code).
- Enhancements including inline annotations, multi-line text blocks, custom directives, and extended block types.
- In-depth error handling and recovery, along with parsing and rendering best practices.
- Implementation guidelines with recommendations for parser libraries, tooling, and testing.

## Getting Started

### Installation
